Step 2 - Climate App:
-------------------
But first execute code app.py at command line: 
python app.py

I have created the second part of the flask in two ways: Easy Way, Tedious Way.



Easy Way:

I created a html file called ClimateApp.html. The ClimateApp.html displays all the hyperlinks to the flask and calls the app.py.
From the folder, please right click on ClimateApp.html and select open with Chrome



This will open a web page with hyperlinks to all links like precipitation, tobs etc.


Tedious way:
You can ignore the ClimateApp.html and instead execute app.py at command line and put the url:
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
